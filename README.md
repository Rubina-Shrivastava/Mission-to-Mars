# Mission-to-Mars
## purpose:
### Purpose of this challenge is add more details to existing MARS site, to make it scraping-friendly. We are adjusting the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, we’ve used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data .
## Result:
